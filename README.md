Dashboards for hackers.

## How to contribute

You may contribute by doing one or many of the following:

1. Use it. Tell your friends. Shout from the rooftop. Maybe.

2. Report a bug using the integrated GitHub issue tracking system.

3. Write code or documentation. We use the awesome [GitFlow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
Essentially: Fork, Edit, Test, Pull Request, QA. Repeat.

## What are we making again?
We are making the quickest damn way on the internet to go from a CSV to an interactive,
collaborative, social-media friendly, fully-customisable dashboard.
